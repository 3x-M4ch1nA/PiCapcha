I saw [this](http://www.commitstrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Strip-Robot-captcha-englsih1.jpg) on Reddit this morning and decided to _try_ write a program that solves it. I decided on a solution that doesn't actually calculate the first n digits and wanted to practice my RESTish skills.

Usage: `node pi.js [optional:start_index] [optional:end_index]`

Thanks MIT for hosting the first billion digits of pi!
